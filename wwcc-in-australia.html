        <h2>State of Play: The Complex Landscape of Working with Children Checks Across Australia</h2>

        <p>
            Anyone who works with, cares for, or volunteers with children under the age of 18 is required to undertake
            screening known as a Working with Children Check (WWCC). By screening individuals involved with children, the
            Working with Children Check is one element of ensuring that children are protected from sexual or physical harm.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout Australia, millions of employees and volunteers hold a Working with Children Check. Each state and
            territory has different legislation governing WWCCs. The result is a mish-mash of rules, regulations,
            exemptions and exclusions that can be a headache for both individuals and organisations trying to do the right
            thing and ensure compliance.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this piece is to provide a resource for organisations that engage staff and volunteers operating
            across multiple states and territories understand and meet their obligations.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-center">The Future of Working with Children Checks</h3>

        <p>
            On 17 August 2015, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse released its report on Working with
            Children Checks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The report noted that "each state and territory has its own scheme, and each of the eight schemes operates
            independently of the others. They are inconsistent and complex, and there is unnecessary duplication across
            the schemes. There is no integration of the schemes, and there is inadequate information sharing and
            monitoring of WWCC cardholders."
        </p>

        <p>
            The Report recommends a national approach to WWCCs. "We have determined that implementing a national
            approach to WWCCs is overdue. For too long, governments have favoured maintaining their own systems over
            working together to achieve a more nationally consistent approach. We have therefore recommended a national
            model for WWCCs, by introducing consistent standards and establishing a centralised WWCC database to
            facilitate cross-border information sharing."
        </p>

        <p>
            You can access the full report
            <a href="http://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/getattachment/7ecd3db9-0b17-483e-9a0e-8fb247140f3e/Working-with-Children-Checks-Report"
               target="_blank">here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            However, in more than 2 years since the report was released, little progress has been made towards a
            national approach. In the meantime, remember to stay up-to-date and compliant with all legislation for your
            state. And if you're planning an interstate trip, and will be working with children in that state, make sure
            you're aware of the specific obligations of that state.
