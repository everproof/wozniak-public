        <p>Everproof is a background screening and verification company, but unlike traditional screening offerings we turn the verified data into a continuous profile that can be shared with multiple third parties. Think of it like a verified LinkedIn profile which can be selectively shared by the owner.</p>
        <p>Launched in February 2016, we are a growing, <a href="https://everproof.com/reinventure-capital-raise/">venture backed</a> start-up that is striving to be one of the top tech companies in the world.  We have ambitious plans and want to bring great people into the Everproof family.</p>
