  <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>

  <div class="guide">
    <h3 class="subheading">Qualification Colours</h3>
    <p>
      Your qualifications will be one of four colours that correspond to the different
      statuses they can hold:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="green">Green:</span> Qualifications that have been <strong>verified</strong> by
        our automatic verification process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="blue">Blue:</span> Non-expired, <strong>valid</strong> qualifications that have
        <strong>not been verified</strong> automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="yellow">Yellow:</span> Any qualifications that are expiring in the <strong>next
        90 days.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="red">Red:</span> <strong>Expired</strong> or <strong>invalid</strong>
        qualifications.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="guide">
    <h3 class="subheading">Claiming of Accounts Explained</h3>
    <p>
      There are three values visible in the Acc. Claimed column on the View People page:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No</strong> - no login email was sent to this person</li>
      <li><strong>Pending</strong> - a login email(s) was sent, but the person hasn't logged in yet</li>
      <li><strong>Yes</strong> - the person has logged into their account</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="guide">
    <h3 class="subheading">Qualification Compliance</h3>
    <p>
      To be listed as compliant for a certain requirement, you’ll want to ensure that
      Qualification Title matches that of the requirement.
      For a Working with Children Check to verify (turn <span class="green">green</span>):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Qualification Title must be “Working with Children Check (VIC)”</li>
      <li>The Institution must be “Department of Justice & Regulation (VIC)”</li>
      <li>The Last name and Document/Card number must match exactly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The expiration date will pull automatically once a Working with Children Check is
      verified.
    </p>

  <div class="guide">
    <h3 class="subheading">View Recent People</h3>
    <p>
      The View People page stores your most recent search information – to view the most up
      to date data and any recent changes, just refresh the page or click Search.
