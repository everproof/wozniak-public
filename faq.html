  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">What is Everproof?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Everproof is an online platform that enables organisations and individuals to store,
        manage, and verify their qualifications and accreditations all in the one secure
        account. Through a simple interface that is accessible on any device 24/7, Everproof
        facilitates the automatic, online sharing of qualifications between employers and
        employees. Everproof solves the problems that many organisations and individuals face
        surrounding the management, retrieval, and verification of qualifications and
        training.

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">
      My organisation already collects information on qualifications, why should we use
      Everproof?
    </h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">Everproof can significantly improve the management of qualifications
        and training for organisations and individuals. By providing the tools to aggregate
        and manage records of qualifications and training online, Everproof reduces the
        administrative burden of handling these records manually. This will save your
        organisation both time and money. Everproof’s online system also reduces the liability
        risks faced by employers and employees by providing a simple method of ensuring
        qualifications and training are both valid and current.

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">Can Everproof work with my organisation’s administration system?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Everproof enables and encourages members of an organisation to contribute to the
        information flow, meaning that Everproof is likely to be an organisation’s most
        up-to-date data source for qualifications and training. For this reason, Everproof
        works effectively as a stand-alone platform alongside your organisation’s existing
        administration system. There is also scope for organisations to have their
        administration system integrated with Everproof,

        very flexible so all organisations can access the great benefits that our system

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">What do the colours of my qualifications represent?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Your qualifications will be one of four colours that correspond to the different
        statuses they can hold:<br>
        <span class="green">Green:</span>
        Qualifications that have been verified by our automatic
        verification process.<br>
        <span class="blue">Blue:</span>
        Non-expired, valid qualifications that have not been verified
        automatically.<br>
        <span class="yellow">Yellow:</span>
        Any qualifications that are expiring in the next 90
        days.<br>
        <span class="red">Red:</span>
        Expired or invalid qualifications.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">What do I do when a qualification is expired?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">If you have your new/renewed qualification, you can add this
        into your account, or edit and update your existing qualification. If you choose
        to add a new qualification, you can edit and expire the existing one. For expired
        qualifications, you can keep these in your account for reference, or delete them
        from view.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">Who can see my qualifications?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        When you add a new qualification to Everproof, you can select who
        should be able to see it. Visible to: Linked Organisations means that any
        organisations you’re connected with can view this qualification. Visible to:
        Only Me means that linked organisations will not be able to see this qualification.
        This allows you to add qualifications for your own personal use, outside of what
        your organisation may require.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">How does Everproof verify my qualifications?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Everproof’s innovative technology runs a verification check with selected institutions
        via an automated process. This means we can verify qualifications more reliably and
        much faster than companies who have a manual verification process.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">Why can only some of my qualifications be verified?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        At this stage, Everproof’s verification functionality only works
        with selected institutions. As we continue to grow, we will be able to verify
        qualifications from more and more institutions as our technology is easily
        compatible with different database structures.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">What if I can’t remember all the details of my qualification?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        That’s okay! Just fill in as much as you can so you can maintain
        a record in your account. We recommend at least getting the expiry date entered
        (if applicable) so you’ll be reminded when it’s due to renew. You can also easily
        upload a photo of the document to keep record of this online.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">Why am I getting email reminders from Everproof?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Everproof only sends email reminders for important events which are: expiring
        qualifications, new qualification requirements, and non-compliance with a current
        role.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">Can I share my qualifications with others?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Your Public qualifications are shared with any organisations
        you’re linked to in Everproof. You can also choose to share all or selected
        qualifications with anyone via email, whether or not they’re a Everproof user.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">How often do I need to update my account?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        You only need to update your account when you have new or
        renewed qualifications. However, your account is available 24/7 online or on your
        mobile.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3 class="subheading">What if I leave the organisation I am working for?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer-container">
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Your Personal Everproof account is yours for life. If you leave the organisation you
        are working with, you can continue to access the benefits of Everproof. We recommend
        having your organisation ensure your Everproof account is tied to a personal email
        address before unlinking you from their account.

        Auto-archive captures a snapshot of all users’ qualifications on a scheduled cycle
        and sends the information to a designated email address. Account Managers can
        always pull this report on an ad hoc basis and all downloads are available within
        Everproof. Snapshots allow you to revisit what qualifications everyone had at a
        particular period in time.
