## What is Everproof?

Everproof is an online platform that allows you to upload and manage qualifications and accreditations such as
Working with Children Checks.

AFL Goulburn Murray is using Everproof so coaches, trainers and other club volunteers can easily manage this important
information online meaning less time is spent on paperwork. Ensuring that everyone is appropriately qualified means
we can provide a safe environment for all involved.
