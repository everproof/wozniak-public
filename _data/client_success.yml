    By enabling staff to manage their own qualifications, Everproof has created a far morerobust and up-to-date
    database of staff qualifications. Moreover, through Everproof's automatic expiry reminders, we have seen an
    increased renewal and compliance rate with reduced administrative effort. I would recommend Everproof to any
    organisation that must manage the regulation and compliance of its staff.

    Everproof is a simple and affordable solution that I can see being incredibly useful across all codes of
    junior sport. I hope that Everproof becomes the industry standard for qualification and accreditation
    management nationally, to help increase the compliance levels in junior sport.

    Everproof is a fantastic system that has been incredibly useful and simple at our basketball association. I
    highly recommend Everproof for all sporting codes to manage accreditations and qualifications, in particular,
    junior sporting organisations.
