At Everproof we are an engineering first company. That doesn't mean we're solely focused on engineering, but it does mean
that we spend a lot of our time thinking deeply about the engineering problems our company faces.

<!--end-excerpt-->

If you look at the breakdown of our current employees, you'll see that we have a three person marketing and sales team,
and a five person engineering team. We know that sales is incredibly important, but our sales team is extremely tightly
integrated into our engineering process. They are the point of contact with our users and provide invaluable insight to
the engineers who are building our product.

We also view engineering talent as a vital part of sales success. We want to build a product that sells itself. A
product that is so usable and easy to navigate that we don't need a sales person to cold call customers, the customers
find our platform, sign up and are set up in seconds. The only way to build such a product is by hiring the best
engineering talent we can find.

Paul Graham has famously said "there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want." We
believe that the best way to build something that users want is to have a talented engineering team who can iterate
and adapt our product at breakneck speed.

At Everproof we're an engineering first company. We don't have roles open that we need to fill, we make roles for people
that we have to hire. If you're interested in working with us, you should send me an email to me,
