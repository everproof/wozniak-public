Coming up with a brand name is hard, really hard, and many companies don’t get it right the first time. BackRub rebranded to Google, Blue Ribbon Sports rebranded to Nike, AuctionWeb rebranded to eBay, and this week BlueQ rebranded to Everproof.

Over a year ago, our quest for the perfect name started sitting at my kitchen table. Countless rounds of word association saw us trying every abbreviation, conjunction, suffix and prefix we could think of, but each time we thought of the perfect name... Bang. The .com was taken. 

This went on for weeks on end and as the names on my bedside notepad filled up with nonsensical 2am scribbles we decided to pull the trigger:

> "That’s it, let’s go with BlueQ. It doesn’t matter that blueq.com is a novelty sock company, we don’t even have any customers yet"

So BlueQ it was, and has been up until this week. Despite having been accidentally tagged in a sock post by a US senator and messaged by people asking about their shipments, the name has served us well.

Yet, we knew the day would come where we would have to rebrand to a name where we could own our global identity. A brand name that spoke to the core of what we do. A brand name that reflects what we are aiming to achieve. That name is Everproof.  

### Everproof
Today we have over 1,000 clients spanning 2 continents. Schools, national sporting bodies, local governments and health clinics now rely on Everproof to ensure their organizations are safe and compliant. I am incredibly proud what our team and product has achieved to date and I feel Everproof more accurately reflects the impact that we have made for these organizations.

Not only does the name encompass many of our key value propositions, we now have that elusive .com. As we continue to grow our global customer base, we have a single identity and reference point for all our users.

So, coming up with a brand name is hard, but we have now learnt that the process of rebranding is complex too. We have received overwhelming support for the new name and I hope that the hard work of our team has made the transition simple for our clients and end-users.

### A Final Word
A final piece of advice, don’t call your company Happy Socks, and if you are trying to think up a new brand name here’s two resources that helped us arrive at Everproof:
