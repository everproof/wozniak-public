Many of our clients have been wondering when the amendments to the Working with Children Check Act 2005 are coming into effect and what impact they may have on their organisation. To help, we have constructed this short post with the key information.

#### When are the amendments coming into effect?
1 August 2017.

#### What are the amendments?
There are five key amendments to the Act which have been implemented in response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. They are:

1. Expansion of the definition of ‘direct contact’ to ensure that people engaging in ‘child-related work’ that involves ‘physical contact’, ‘face to face contact’, ‘oral’, ‘written’ or electronic communication’ are required to obtain a Working with Children Check. However, a Working With Children Check will not be required in circumstances where the contact with a child is occasional and incidental to the work.
2. Remove references to ‘supervision’ from the Act to establish that, to determine whether a person requires a Check, the supervision of a person’s contact with a child is irrelevant. This will enable easier interpretation of the Check’s requirements in situations where it may have been unclear whether a person’s contact with a child was supervised.
3.	‘Kinship care’ to become a new occupational category of ‘child-related work’. This will require family members (and other persons of significance to a child) providing a child with out-of-home care under the *Children, Youth and Families Act 2005* to obtain a Check.
4.	Non-conviction charges (charges that have been finally dealt with other than by a conviction or finding of guilt for the most serious offences for the purposes of the Check) will now form part of a relevant criminal history for the purposes of category C assessments and re-assessments.
5.	Enable the Secretary to the Department of Justice and Regulation to compel the production of certain information for the purposes of compliance monitoring.

#### Are there any other changes I should be aware of?
Other technical and miscellaneous amendments have also been made to enhance the Act’s operation and administration. We will be updating this post as more information is made available closer to August.
