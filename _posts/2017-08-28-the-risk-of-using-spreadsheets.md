### Are you still using spreadsheets to manage the everyday functions of your business?


Many companies use Excel spreadsheets to collate and store important information. But if you've ever been responsible 
for managing these documents, you'll know it can take a significant amount of time and energy to keep spreadsheets 
up-to-date. 

There's also the constant risk of critical business data being deleted, lost or entered incorrectly through human error. 
Which does happen, particularly when multiple team members are working on the same document.

These days, there are smarter ways to manage your data than using an Excel spreadsheet, while allowing you to save time, 
money and energy in the process. The best solution? Ditch the old Excel spreadsheets and move your important information 
online. 

### Manage Employee Qualifications Online

One of the many ways spreadsheets are used by businesses is to record and track the various qualifications, 
accreditations and training certificates of their staff or volunteers. 

These documents are generally issued to individuals in the form of hard copy certificates or cards, which are then 
relegated to the back of desk drawers, wallets or ... who knows where! HR departments will often take a photocopy or 
scan of the documents, then manually enter the details into Excel. 

But as we said earlier, spreadsheets are not the most reliable method of managing critical information. And they 
certainly won't tell you if a qualification has expired or been revoked. 

By switching to an online tool, you can digitise and collate all staff and volunteer qualifications in a single safe, 
reliable and accessible system. Accessing staff qualifications digitally from your laptop, tablet or phone is much more 
convenient than rifling through hard copy files back at the office. 

### Save Time and Effort on Admin Tasks

You'll also be reducing the significant amount of time spent on daily administrative tasks by office staff. For Knox 
Childcare & Kindergarten, moving to an online system proved to be a much more effective way to manage staff 
qualifications.

Instead of having to collect, store and manage staff qualifications manually, individual staff members can now manage 
their own account and upload qualifications straight into the system.

upload [digital copies of their qualifications themselves and "become compliant almost immediately](

There's no need to worry about setting reminders for expiring qualifications, as the online system will automatically 
keep you informed. 

### Avoid Compliance Risks and Fines

By moving staff qualifications online, you'll also be reducing the risk of compliance issues. 

When it comes to vital qualifications such as Working with Children Checks (WWCC), your staff need those critical 
accreditations to do their job – and it's up to you as an employer to have a reliable system in place to manage this. 
If spreadsheets aren't tended to properly, with all data kept secure and up-to-data, you could be leaving your 
organisation open to serious compliance risks. 

Allowing employees or volunteers to continue working without the correct qualifications puts your organisation at risk 
of liability. There are severe consequences of non-compliance, including legal proceedings, fines, and loss of income 
and reputation. As an employer, it's also your number one priority to create a safe work environment for the children 
and adults in your care. 

### Know the Status of All Qualifications

Like many sporting organisations, Cricket Victoria used manual processes to track whether their staff and volunteers 
had the right qualifications for their roles. 
Managing critical data such as WWCC and coaching accreditations was done "[through a combination of Excel worksheets, 
scanned hard copies and hard work by volunteer administrators](

This meant that there was no way of monitoring the status of qualifications, or whether a staff member's accreditations 
had become expired, or even worse, revoked. Moving employee and volunteer qualifications to an online system provided 
Cricket Victoria with an easy way of ensuring all WWCCs are both valid and current. Digitising this information enables 
it to be more easily validated against the issuing database; a considerably manual and impractical task when it is 
stored in hard copy. 

### Measure and Track Your Compliance

Using an online platform will also provide you with the tools you need to measure compliance, giving you important 
insight into the overall compliance of your organisation. This way, you can track your compliance performance and 
improvements – which just can't be done with an Excel spreadsheet, no matter how awesome your Excel skills are!

Moving online has seen an increase of compliance across the Cricket Victoria organisation. There was previously no way 
to measure compliance across the state, but with an online system:

that's definitely worth investing in.
