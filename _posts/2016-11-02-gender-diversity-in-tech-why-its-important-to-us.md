The team at Everproof is growing quickly. Over the last 7 months, our team has tripled in size with our intake primarily
focused on software engineers. We have seen first-hand the gender disparity in the industry - particularly at
engineering careers nights and through the job applications we have received - and we want to do something about it.

There is a significant gap in ICT and software industries around the world; with the number of females employed in
tech at only 28 per cent. The lack of gender diversity within ICT appears to be symptomatic of the small number of
women entering technical education. According to an Australian Council of Learned Academies report (2013),
only 15 per cent of people enrolled in tertiary ICT courses are female.

Increasing discussion about gender diversity in tech recently led tech giants Google, Facebook and Yahoo! to release
their organisation's diversity reports. Overall, the reports showed males make up 60-70 per cent of employees at each
company. This figure rises closer to 80 per cent when examining leadership roles.

As Everproof is in its early stages of growth, we are in the fortunate position to learn from these well-established
companies and aim to build a gender diverse company from early on, rather than as an after-thought.

### Why is diversity important to us?

In order to provide the best possible product to our customers we believe we need insights and contributions from a
diverse group of people. A diverse team will lead us to better ideas, perspectives and solutions.

Just as important as it is to provide a great product, internally we want to provide the best culture and workplace
for our employees. I was recently asked in an interview: "What is the main thing you have learnt since starting your
business that you did not expect?" and my answer immediately was the importance that culture plays in helping achieve
our mission. I view gender diversity as an integral part of growing and sustaining a successful, dynamic and innovative
company culture; which is then reflected through our offering.

I think it is important that I acknowledge that gender diversity is an area that we are wanting to improve upon at
Everproof and I hope that in time we become an example for other organisations to look up to. On our journey to date, I
have been fortunate enough to learn and be mentored by some amazing female entrepreneurs, such as Tessa Herd-Court of
IntelligenceBank, who have helped shape the businessperson I am today. I have also seen first-hand the aforementioned
intangible benefits that hiring a female has had in shifting the culture of our previously male led organisation. It is
these experiences that drive my passion for gender diversity and make me want to lead a change in the industry.

I am glad to see a number of initiatives such as [Girls in Tech][], [Code the Future][] and [Code Like a Girl][],
that are addressing the gender gap in tech and are actively inspiring women to enter into the field.

The industry still has a long way to go and a diverse team isn't something that will happen on it's own. However, we
are excited to be part of the change towards gender diversity within the tech industry and I am proud of the steps we
are taking to increase diversity at Everproof.

*We are actively seeking more female talent within the tech, account management and sales skillsets. If you are
