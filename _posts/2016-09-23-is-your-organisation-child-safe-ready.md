On 1 January 2017 the new Victorian compulsory Child Safe Standards come into effect for all organisations
that deal with children.

As the deadline for the new Victorian Child Safe Standards has drawn closer, our services at Everproof have grown as we
have been inundated with requests from our Victorian clients asking us for advice on how we could further help them
comply with the Standards. In response to these requests, we created [childsafeready.com.au][ChildSafeReady] - a short
self-assessment and suite of free resources and tailored information to help organisations meet the
Child Safe Standards.

### Do the standards apply to you?

"Victorian organisations that provide services to children will be required under the Child Safety and Wellbeing Act
to ensure that they implement compulsory child safe standards to protect children from harm.

Everproof helps organisations meet the Child Safe Standards, in particular Standard 4, by automatically verifying the
validity of Working With Children Checks on a weekly basis. This helps saves organisations the effort by running these
checks automatically once a week and providing notifications of any negative result.

Without Everproof, checking whether an individual has a valid Working with Children Check is a manual and time consuming
process - their name and card number must be entered on the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation's Check
Status Facility each time it needs to be checked. This is a highly manual process and for organisations that have a
large number of employees and volunteers, it can be very time-consuming to ensure everyone holds a valid Working with
Children Check.

*Everproof is offering 15 minute consultations to help organisations become Child Safe Ready for 1st January 2017. To take
self-assessment and book a 15-minute consultation visit [childsafeready.com.au][ChildSafeReady].*
