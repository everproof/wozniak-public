Established in 1893, [Swimming Victoria] is the peak body for the sport of swimming in Victoria. With the introduction of the [Victorian Child Safe Standards], Swimming Victoria was looking for a solution to ensure it continues to provide a safe, welcoming environment for its members and participants.

When Sharon (Clubs & Officials Services Manager) first heard about Everproof, three things about the system stood out: the verification of Working with Children Checks, the ability to streamline processes by replacing paperwork and spreadsheets, and the ease of checking compliance of affiliated clubs. Six months after implementing Everproof, Sharon has noticed an increase in transparency and a commitment to child safety throughout the Swimming Victoria network.

### Transparency of compliance over clubs and members

Swimming Victoria has approximately 150 affiliated swimming clubs & districts and over 11,500 members. Prior to using Everproof, Swimming Victoria did not audit clubs to ensure whether members had valid Working with Children Checks due to the sheer amount of work involved in doing so. Instead, Swimming Victoria had spreadsheets and registers for tracking qualifications, each managed by different staff. Using Everproof, these registers have been centralised, allowing Sharon and her colleagues to easily oversee the compliance and safety of clubs and members.

### Automated verification of Working with Children Checks has led to an increase in compliance

In conversations with swimming clubs, Sharon believed that a number of swimming clubs were not actively checking the validity of Working with Children Checks whilst others were not aware that they should have been doing so. There were also a few clubs that didn’t have a WWCC register. Clubs that were keeping a register of Checks did so by storing photocopies or collating records in a spreadsheet.

### Reduction in staff time and eliminating double-handling of documents

Prior to using Everproof there was double handling of member accreditations. Working with Children Check cards “were handled up to four times” being checked by the swimming club, Swimming Victoria and again at regular swim meets. A digital record is now stored in one location and [automatically verified in Everproof]. Swimming Victoria, Districts & Clubs now all have this information on hand when required.

Everproof empowers individuals to take responsibility for managing their own accreditations and compliance. Using Everproof, individuals upload their own Working with Children Check and additional qualifications which “takes the burden away from volunteers and administrators at clubs and provides visibility of what qualifications their members have.”  

With Everproof, Swimming Victoria can be confident that there is the best possible process in place to ensure a safe environment for participants.
