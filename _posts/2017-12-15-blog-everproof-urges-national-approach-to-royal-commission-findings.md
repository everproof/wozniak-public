A systematic overhaul of the inconsistent working with children checks system is being urged as a priority for reform as the Governor General is set to receive the findings from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse.

The recommendation for a national approach was first made in the Commission’s [2015 Report on WWCCs], but in the years since the report the Commonwealth Government has taken no action. Victims and advocates alike have questioned, with no evidence of action being taken so far, whether anything will happen with the release of the $500m Commission’s full report.

Nathan Merzvinskis, CEO of Everproof, is urging for these reforms to be made a priority having worked closely with national sporting organisations and charities that must ensure thousands of staff and volunteers are screened and hold valid WWCCs.

> “I’ve spoken to countless national sporting organisations and charities and we are all crying out for the same thing - for the Commonwealth Government to make this a priority by implementing a consistent approach to WWCCs. Without a nationally consistent regime, it is getting increasingly more difficult for organisations to provide safe environments for children nationwide” said Mr Merzvinskis.

Each state and territory has its own WWCC which the Commission’s 2015 report has already identified as “inconsistent and complex.” From a practical perspective, this causes headaches for community and sporting organisations who are doing their best to comply with the different laws but often lack the resources to do so.

> “At Everproof we see this time and time again. Sporting teams who travel interstate for tournaments or roving community workers are confused about their WWCC and screening obligations. The complexity surrounding what should be a simple process often means this is placed in the too hard basket by volunteer run organisations. Unfortunately, the result of this is people declining to volunteer their time due to the red tape of applying for various checks or, worse, people becoming involved despite not having the appropriate clearance.”

To further add to the problem, WWCCs and other screening information is frequently entered manually into spreadsheets or stored as paper photocopies by organisations. Not only is this unreliable and prone to error, it also creates a lot of manual administrative work for volunteer run organisations. Sporting clubs and community organisations that regularly work across multiple jurisdictions often have to keep multiple registers of photocopies and would benefit the most from a consistent approach in this area.

“I’m very passionate about the work we’re doing with organisations to ensure that individuals in contact with children have been appropriately screened. However, until there is a nationally consistent approach we fear that people will continue to slip between the cracks and children will continue to be exposed to unnecessary risk,” said Mr Merzvinskis.

The Working with Children Check isn’t a fool proof method for flagging individuals who are not suitable to work with children, but it is the best tool available. Until the system is nationalised, there will continue to be gaps in the system, which expose children to unnecessary risk.

The 2015 Report stated that a national approach to WWCCs is long overdue. In more than two years since the report was released, little progress has been made towards a national approach. After a long and painful Royal Commission, the time is now to take decisive action because every child deserves to be safe.
