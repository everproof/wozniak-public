As the [Child Abuse Royal Commission] examines the serious issue of sexual abuse in junior sport, we should all be
thinking about the other risks that need to be addressed to make sure all children can enjoy the benefits of sport
and recreation in a safe environment.

Since founding [Everproof], I have been in contact with countless sporting organisations ranging from small clubs to large
leagues. I have spoken to many administrators in these organisations and discovered that alarmingly few of
them have reliable processes in place to ensure their officials - be it coaches, umpires, trainers or
volunteers - are appropriately qualified to be involved in junior sport. I have heard of organisations storing
important qualification information like Working With Children Checks on mobile phones or as photocopies that are
filed away and forgotten about or lost. It is processes like this that expose children to an unacceptable risk of
harm and that need to be improved.

Throughout Australia, 1.7 million children aged 5 to 14 participate in organised sport - a remarkable level of
engagement of which all sporting codes can be proud. With this level of participation, it is concerning that junior
sporting organisations and their governing bodies do not have the best practices in place to ensure a safe
environment in which children can participate. Perhaps one of the causes of this issue is that important
administrative tasks are often neglected because they can be time consuming and tedious. Indeed, collating
qualification information, maintaining up-to-date medical records or implementing a complaint handling process are
hardly the tasks that parents have in mind when volunteering to help out with their child's sports team. However, the
reality is that these administrative tasks are integral in ensuring that children are safe when participating in
junior sport.

Fortunately, there are now a number of tailored products that can assist sporting organisations in maintaining a safe
sporting environment for children. For example, [Play By The Rules] offers free online training in child protection,
harassment and discrimination, complaint handling and member protection. Our platform, [Everproof], makes it easy for
organisations to store the qualifications and accreditations of all coaches, officials and volunteers, enabling both
clubs and governing bodies to ensure that everyone involved in junior sport is qualified to do so. In addition to this,
organisations like Play by the Rules are working hard to assist all involved in junior sport prevent and deal with
discrimination, harassment, child safety and integrity issues in sport.

The current Royal Commission should prompt all sporting clubs and leagues at all levels to examine their current
processes to ensure that the best practices are implemented to ensure a safe environment for junior sport to take place.
