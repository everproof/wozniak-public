Verifying Working with Children Checks is integral to ensuring a safe organisation. Ongoing verification is a reliable method of identifying if an individual has their WWCC revoked or is expiring soon. However, often it is a time consuming and frustrating task.

Organisations in other states are not required by law to regularly verify WWCCs, but doing so is best practice, reduces risk and promotes safety.
