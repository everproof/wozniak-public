Some Australians are paying up to $6,500 for high quality forgeries of degrees from nearly 100 of Australia's top
learning institutions. Whilst this might seem like a lot, it is up to 75% less than genuine graduates who are
spending years and on average $25,000 to earn their degree.

Forgery businesses are taking advantage of the high demand for qualified employees. One Chinese forgery business
whose name translates to "Overseas Students Assistant HD", was selling forged qualifications from 43 universities
and 53 TAFEs around Australia. The business also claimed to have the ability to be able to input false records into
official online registers run by the Chinese Ministry of Education.

In today's increasingly competitive business landscape, it's hardly surprising that some job seekers are opting to
include false information on their CVs. Qualifications, education and experience all impact the chances in landing a
job interview.

Forgery businesses use a range of techniques to replicate testamurs security features, making it near on impossible
for hiring teams to tell the difference between legitimate and forged testamurs. Organisations can receive hundreds of
applications for one job, limiting the time they can spend reviewing each application. It is unrealistic to expect
recruitment advisors to inspect each testamur for customised security features from institutes from around the world,
especially without an authentic document to compare to.

With the rise of social media, access to forgery businesses is increasing and the forgery of documents more
commonplace. Despite a majority of false qualifications being used to secure entry-level jobs, top executives are
also falsifying information on their CVs. This is a concern for firms without appropriate verification measures,
leaving them suseptible to hiring unqualified employees and impacting the organisation's credibility in the marketplace.

Everproof provides secure and comprehensive verification of qualifications, which can save organisations time and effort
in verifying applicant documents and limit the risk of hiring unqualified staff.
