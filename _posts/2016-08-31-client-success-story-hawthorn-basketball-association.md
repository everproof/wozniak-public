The [Hawthorn Basketball Association][HBA] is a junior and senior basketball competition operating in Melbourne's
eastern suburbs. Decades old and continuing to grow, the HBA manages over 150 referees that officiate matches
ranging from under 9s to senior men and women.

"Rostering referees for hundreds of matches a week takes a lot of time and effort." The new Child Safe Standards
which come into effect from 1 January 2017 prompted Andrew to look for a simple and cost effective solution to
manage and verify Working With Children Checks and other qualifications. This led the HBA to implement Everproof which
Andrew says "provided us with immediate benefit". The HBA has seen an improvement in its overall compliance rate 
and over 180 WWCCs have been verified since the HBA rolled out Everproof.

Prior to implementing Everproof, the HBA was using an Excel spreadsheet to manage referee accreditations and Working
With Children Checks in an attempt to ensure referees were able to officiate. One staff member was responsible for
manually inputting this important information without any verification process.

Andrew found this process exposed the HBA to institutional risk because it was difficult to pick up when someone's
WWCC lapsed, or when referees were turning 18 years old and needed a WWCC. Now all referees are given their own Everproof
accounts where they can manage their own WWCCs which are visible by the HBA. Both the HBA and individuals are
notified if a WWCC expires or becomes invalid.

Overall, Andrew has found that Everproof has benefitted the HBA by providing "peace of mind that information is accurate
and reminders of upcoming expirations". Everproof also saves the HBA the time and effort of chasing up its referees for
photocopies and scanned records of qualifications.
