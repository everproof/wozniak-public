Currently in Victoria, only student-facing staff at universities are required to have a WWCC. On the 16th
June 2017, Swinburne University of Technology announced that they are committed to verifying that all
staff, including existing, new, volunteers, agency and prospective have a valid Working with Children
Check (WWCC).

This decision has been made in response to the new Victorian Government Child Safe Standards, which
announced new legislation for ensuring that organisations who deal with children set up consistent
and relevant measures to guarantee that every child is safe. Swinburne additionally developed and
implemented new strategies to reduce risks to children.

"Universities are required to ensure student-facing staff have a valid WWCC, however at Swinburne we
believe for a true commitment to child safety, all staff must comply", says Swinburne Vice-Chancellor
Professor Linda Kristjanson AO.

At Everproof, we commend Swinburne's commitment to fostering a framework and culture of child safety. These
changes will hopefully set a precedent across the rest of Victorian universities, along with all
organisations across Australia that provide services for children to follow in Swinburneâ€™s footsteps.
