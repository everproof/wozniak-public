         and mitigate institutional risk.

#### A more robust database of qualification and training records
Prior to implementing Everproof, Trinity was using its existing HR/payroll system to store qualifications and training
records. This database was often incomplete or out of date because it was reliant on staff to provide a member of
the administration team with hard copy record of any new or renewed qualification. By contrast, "Everproof's easy-to-use
interface encouraged and incentivised staff to engage with the system. By enabling staff to manage their own
qualifications and actively contribute to the information flow, Everproof has created a far more robust and up-to-date
database of staff qualifications whilst eliminating the need for a member of our administration team to undertake
the time consuming task of entering this data."

> Ultimately, implementing Everproof has highlighted areas of compliance that were not fully addressed by our existing
payroll/HR system. I believe that by using Everproof, we now have the best possible processes in place to ensure a
compliant and safe work place.

#### Child Safe Standards: Automated verification of Working With Children Checks & VIT Registrations
Trinity also benefits from Everproof's automated verification of WWCCs and VIT Registrations which run on a scheduled
cycle once a week. No longer does Trinity have a static database of WWCC information for non-teaching staff, contractors
and volunteers which required constant oversight. Instead, Everproof checks the validity of the WWCCs automatically and
Trinity administration staff are notified if a WWCC has been revoked or invalidated. This means a staff member no
longer has to manually enter WWCC information one-by-one on the DOJ's Check Status Facility each time Trinity wants to
ensure a WWCC is valid. Everproof also picks up individuals that have not registered Trinity as an affiliated organisation.

Kirsty says that, "through Everproof's automatic verification and expiry reminders, we have seen an increased renewal and
compliance rate with reduced administrative effort."
