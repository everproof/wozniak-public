St Catherine's is a leading girls' school in Melbourne. For more than 120 years, they have been nurturing young women 
to be independent, resilient, and creative. They have built a reputation for their excellent staff, state of the art 
facilities, and supportive community. St Catherine's has a strong commitment to child safety and is always looking for 
ways to improve in this area. 

#### Previously, managing qualifications was manual, time consuming and ineffective

St Catherine's was struggling to manage qualifications and certifications for their staff and volunteers prior to using 
Everproof. Qualifications were requested from staff and volunteers at the beginning of their tenure and then recorded in 
school-management software, Synergetic as well as Excel spreadsheets. 

Each term, HR Manager, Cassie Monahan, would do a manual audit of qualifications and write a letter to each staff member 
with an expiring or missing qualification requesting evidence of attainment or renewal. Sometimes, Cassie would have to 
follow-up multiple 
times to ensure the person was compliant – this put a strain on Cassie and her team. 

For all the time and effort expended to ensure staff and volunteers were compliant, the results weren't there - "the 
process was manual, but it also wasn't effective." The led Cassie to look for a solution to streamline the important 
area of ensuring staff compliance. Cassie discovered Everproof after hearing about Trinity Grammar School's experience from 
Everproof founder, Hugh Krantz. 

Getting setup with Everproof was really smooth – the transition and integration into existing process has been simple
Cassie says that the setup and ongoing support has been "fantastic – we cannot fault the service we've had. No question 
has been too small and Everproof has provided a really fast turnaround time with any queries or feedback."

#### Everproof has created a shift in mindset – staff now take responsibility for their compliance

Initially, Cassie was unsure about whether staff would take to Everproof as another system for them to manage and update. 
However, after implementing Everproof, Cassie noted that the feedback from staff was "really positive." Staff are now taking 
responsibility for ensuring their ongoing compliance and are even "excited to update their VIT Registration details in 
Everproof!" Cassie noted that a new staff member was recently setup on Everproof and had uploaded all of their qualifications 
and was compliant within a day. 

> "Everproof has allowed us to reach a level of compliance that we've been trying to achieve to for a long time"

Within a matter of seconds, Cassie can now know with certainty exactly what St Catherine's compliance rate is. In the 
first 30 days, Cassie has seen compliance rise from 60% to 92% and expects the school to reach 100% compliance within 
a matter of weeks. 

**Cassie would "definitely" recommend Everproof to others and is now confident that her staff are compliant on an ongoing basis. St Catherine's is now extending Everproof to their parents and volunteers.**
