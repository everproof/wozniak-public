- Everproof is an online platform that enables individuals and organisations to store, manage and verify qualifications
  online.

- GO1 is a learning management system and online content marketplace offering flexible training and education options.

- Everproof has partnered with GO1 to enable its users a wide variety of options to renew qualifications through and
  upskill their education.

Everproof is pleased to announce that it will be significantly expanding its network of affiliated course providers
through a strategic partnership with GO1.

GO1 is Australia's leading marketplace for course providers and online training content, bringing together a wide
variety of training modules and qualifications that they make available to the public. Many of the most popular
qualifications that have been uploaded to Everproof to date are offered through GO1's network of course providers. As such,
this partnership has created a lot of mutual value for the users of these two platforms.

Through this partnership, a Everproof user will be able to renew and upskill their education from a wide array of course
providers. The availability and transparency of this information gives the power to the individual in taking control
of their own education.

As commented by Everproof's CEO, Nathan Merzvinskis, *"at Everproof, our whole aim through digitising qualifications is to make
the lives of our users easier; the GO1 partnership does just that. A Everproof user will now be able to find course
providers to renew their qualifications through instantly and relevant courses to upskill their education. Without our
joint platforms, this same user would need to store their certificate in hard copy, track when it is expiring and then
scour the web for a course that is affordable and available in their location."* This partnership exemplifies the
benefits of digitising qualifications and the myriad of advantages that this brings about.

GO1's Head of Strategic Partnerships, Melvyn Lubega, further commented that *"being able to make a range of leading
training solutions available on demand for individuals, as well as managers wanting to ensure their teams remain
compliant and correctly skilled, is a powerful value proposition which our partnership with Everproof enables."*

We are excited to continue to grow this relationship and continue to create benefit for our expanding base of users
and course providers.
