We live in an almost paperless, digital world. But there are still some things we insist on carrying around in paper
form. To do lists, business cards, certificates, loyalty cards, receipts, IDs and transport tickets fill our cluttered
wallets and handbags, and are often forgotten about.

<!--end-excerpt-->

Here are 5 platforms you can use to digitise your wallet.

### [1. Rewardle][Rewardle]

Do you ever get to the supermarket and realise you left your groceries list at home? Or maybe your list was written in
rushed and illegible handwriting. Wunderlist allows you to easily organise all your tasks, set reminders, and share
your list of things to do within one app.

### [4. Google Wallet][Google Wallet]

Google Wallet provides you with a fast, easy, and free way to send money to friends and family. Google Wallet enables
you to split expenses between friends so everyone pays their equal share and request money from others and track when
they pay you back.

### [5. ScanBizCards][ScanBizCards]

Business cards are a great networking tool, but carrying around and storing hundreds of business cards isn't practical
or easy. ScanBizCards is a business card app scanner with cloud backup, and can sync across a number of devices. The
app also connects with Evernote, Salesforce and other CRM platforms.
