#### Access staff qualifications anywhere, anytime, on any device
Company Director, Sarah Tullberg, was first attracted to Everproof due to its automatic verification of Working with
Children Checks. Since using the system now for 4 months, Sarah has found an extremely valuable part of Everproof is being
able to access staff records at any time, from any place.

Knox Childcare and Kindergarten was previously storing staff qualifications and certificates as printed hard copies
and scans. Sarah often works remotely so accessing staff qualifications digitally from her tablet device is much more
convenient than driving to the office and checking the hard copy files. Sarah also finds it helpful to be able to
access staff documents when working on weekends or at times when the centre is closed.

#### Drill down into compliance issues in seconds
Sarah's favourite part about Everproof is being able to "quickly and easily see the overall compliance of the organisation
and drill down into compliance issues if needed" through Everproof's Compliance Dashboard. The compliance dashboard shows
the overall compliance rate of the organisation in real time and alerts Sarah to any staff that do not meet the
compliance requirements set for their role.

#### Onboarding new staff is a breeze
Onboarding staff and collecting their relevant documents and certificates can be a time-consuming task. However, Sarah
recently onboarded a new staff member with the help of Everproof, and found the process of getting them up and running on
the system a breeze. Instead of having to collect, store and manage staff qualifications, individual staff members
manage their own account and upload their own qualifications into the system. The new staff member uploaded digital
copies of their qualifications and "was compliant almost immediately", lessening the administration workload for office
staff.

#### Peace of mind your organisation is meeting the Child Safe Standards
Everproof has also helped Knox Childcare and Kindergarten meet the new Victorian Chid Safe Standards that require
organisations to regularly check the validity of all staff and volunteer WWCC cards, and keep a register of all WWCC's.
Everproof's system automatically checks the validity of staff WWCC on a weekly basis and alerts administrators if a staff
member's card has expired or has been revoked. Ultimately, Everproof provides Knox Childcare and Kindergarten peace of mind
their staff are always qualified and compliant for their roles.
