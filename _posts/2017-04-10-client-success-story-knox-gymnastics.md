Prior to using Everproof, Knox Gymnastics Club was managing coach and volunteer qualifications by storing photocopies of certificates and trying to maintain a spreadsheet of this information.

Rebecca Tilley, Operations Manager, said this process was disorganised and difficult to maintain. Due to the time consuming process to verify Working with Children Checks using the check status facility, Rebecca said that Working with Children Checks weren't verified regularly and therefore they weren't confident that all their staff were compliant.

She heard about Everproof from Gymnastics Victoria who suggested Everproof to help gymnastics clubs meet the Victorian Child Safe Standards, and were ultimately sold on the easy way to manage staff qualifications that takes a huge amount of administrative work off their hands.

#### A confidence boost

Everproof has highlighted to Knox Gymnastics Club what areas and policies they need to be proactive about. Everproof has also provided staff with more of an understanding of their responsibilities in ensuring they have up-to-date certificates.

Rebecca now has the confidence that staff are compliant, participants are safe and that Knox Gymnastics Club is successfully meeting the Child Safe Standards.

An additional bonus is having less paperwork lying around and being able to clean up their office!

#### Easy, straightforward and self-explanatory set up

Rebecca said the process of getting up and running with Everproof was easy, straightforward and self-explanatory. She shared that the support they have received from Everproof customer service has been great and response time has been very quick, allowing her to have changes made or questions answered almost straight away.

#### One less thing to worry about

Personally, Rebecca's favourite thing about Everproof is not having to check the expiry date of her Working with Children Check, knowing that Everproof will automatically notify her when it is soon to expire. In the context of Knox Gymnastics Club, Rebecca's favourite thing about Everproof is having one less thing to worry about, referring to it as a "weight off my mind".
