Volunteers across the country are the backbone of many Australian sporting clubs, community events and non-profit organisations. 

Whether you're helping to coach a youth cricket team, or lending a hand at your local library, volunteering obviously takes a lot of time and commitment – and most people expect that when getting on board. However, they may not be as prepared for the various legal and administrative requirements for volunteering, which can often become quite complex and time-consuming. 

This came to light in a recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia (PwC). The 2016 report, ['Help Create Happiness: The State of Volunteering in Australia,'](https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/wp-content/uploads/State-of-Volunteering-in-Australia-full-report.pdf) detailed the trends, demographics, challenges and successes in the volunteering sector in Australia. 

### Complex Admin Processes Deterring Australian Volunteers

Through surveys of Australian volunteers, the report examined some of the reasons why people are deterred from stepping into a volunteering role. One of the top four reasons was because of the "burdensome administrative requirements" involved in being a volunteer. 
"The ever-increasing red tape … police check every time you volunteer for a different organisation, the restrictions in what volunteers can undertake, the ongoing surveillance, health and safety structures, all of these things do inhibit volunteers," said one volunteer. 

When asked how organisations could improve the volunteering experience, survey respondents suggested that the day-to-day management practices of volunteers were often inadequate. 

### Administration Burdens for Organisations with Volunteers

But it's not just volunteers who are challenged and frustrated by red tape and endless admin tasks. Companies spend significant time, money and energy on recruiting, scheduling and managing their volunteers.

> Screening volunteers, particularly those working with children, is one of the most time-consuming tasks, with Australian companies required to run and keep track of Working with Children Checks (WWC), criminal records checks, medicals, and other reference and qualification checks. For many businesses, this involves staff or club administrators spending hours sifting through documents, manually typing them into Excel spreadsheets, and keeping those spreadsheets up-to-date and in order. 

Volunteering also raises a number of important legal issues for organisations, around the areas of workplace safety, insurance and even visa work restrictions. And these too can cause barriers for organisations in terms of volunteer involvement. As one survey respondent said, "administration tasks, bureaucracy and risk mitigation have taken precedence over intrinsic movements and people's altruistic value." 

### A Better Way to Meet the Requirements of Volunteering

With [86% of Australian volunteering organisations](https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/wp-content/uploads/State-of-Volunteering-in-Australia-full-report.pdf) needing more hands on deck, it's important we reduce these kinds of barriers and deterrents as much as possible. 
Appropriate screening processes and qualification checks are imperative – that goes without saying. What's needed is a better way for organisations to manage the day-to-day practices of their volunteers, while also making sure all legal requirements are being met. And that's where [Everproof](https://Everproof.com/) comes into the picture. 
Everproof helps your business to alleviate the amount of time and effort spent on administrative tasks. By digitising important documents like qualifications, WWCs, police checks and medicals, you can greatly reduce repetitive and time-consuming practices, [replacing your old Excel spreadsheets](https://Everproof.com/blog/2017/08/28/the-risk-of-using-spreadsheets/) and manual processes with a smart online solution.  

Volunteers can easily provide evidence of their qualifications to a new sporting club, community group or employer. And once these are in the Everproof system, they won't need to be uploaded again each season! Staff and club administrators will be spared from hours of manual checking to see if their volunteers are compliant, with the online platform identifying any volunteers with expired qualifications or revoked Working with Children Checks. This also helps to create a safer environment for all involved. 

By saving time and energy in this way, Everproof empowers volunteer organisations to do what they do best – working to give back to the community and improving the lives of others. Because that's what volunteering is really all about.
