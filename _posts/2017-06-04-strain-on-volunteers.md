Volunteers are the lifeblood of grassroots sporting clubs and associations – without them thousands of Australian children and adults would not be able to participate in sport. As a volunteer at my local cricket club, I understand the time constraints and the duties that are involved with volunteering. 

To give this some perspective, Victorian netball volunteers spend 180,726 hours administering netball each week. That’s the equivalent of 4,756 people working full time! 

This is not just something we see in netball clubs and associations, it’s standard across all sports. To retain volunteers, it’s important that some administrative tasks are made easier so volunteers can engage more out on the court or on the field. 

Since starting Everproof, I’ve spoken to hundreds of people involved in grass roots sporting clubs and associations at a range of levels. Whether I’m chatting to a committee member, president, scorer, coach, something that consistently is expressed is that they’re very eager to volunteer their time for their sporting club or association. Additional requirements, such as the Child Safe Standards, whilst incredibly important, are putting additional stress on volunteers. For some, this can be a deterrent to them giving up their time. 

### One of our key objectives at Everproof is to reduce some of the administrative and time consuming tasks which volunteers face.

Previously, volunteers would have to rummage through their filing cabinets and wallets to find their Working with Children Checks, first aid certificates and other important documents at the start of every season. Club administrators would then spend hours sifting through these documents, typing them into an Excel spreadsheet one by one. 

Everproof allows all this important information to be stored in a digital form meaning volunteers can easily provide evidence of their qualifications to their club. Once these are in Everproof, then they don’t have to be uploaded again each season. Club administrators also save hours of time with no more manual checking to se if everyone’s compliant, and to identify any volunteers that may no longer be allowed to be involved due to expired qualifications or revoked Working with Children Checks. 

By alleviating volunteers of these administrative tasks, instead of wading through paperwork, volunteers can focus their time and energy on getting back out on the field!
