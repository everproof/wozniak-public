From the moment a second person joins your start up, culture begins. The way that early employees and founders interact
with each other sets a cultural tone that can last for years to come.

At Everproof, strong and positive company culture is an integral part to growing our business, achieving success and
retaining employees. We've made a strong effort to establish culture early and continue to evolve our culture as our
team grows. In our first year, the Everproof team, internally known as "The Qs" have developed some key cultural values.

### Building relationships and creating traditions

A key aspect to Everproof's culture is building relationships and creating traditions. We have recently started monthly
"Coffee Catch-Ups". Every month team members are randomly paired with someone else from the team. Each pair goes out
for a coffee together to learn more about this person and connect on a more personal level.

### Collaborating across departments

Not only does our team interact on a personal basis, there is strong cross-training and collaboration across
departments. The team is encouraged to not only think about their role - but to think about all aspects of the
business and share ideas even if they are outside their area of expertise. Mid last year we ran a User Experience (UX)
session involving the whole team. Despite not everyone having a UX background, each person contributed many great
ideas and thoughts which reflected their individual strengths and skillsets.

### Making new employees feel a part of the team

Since starting out this year, Everproof has grown from 2 to 10 employees. The on-boarding process has developed as the
company has grown. Over time we've encouraged staff to take on varying responsibilities within the on boarding process
for new team members, for example taking the new staff member for the office tour, Our co-founders, Nathan, Hugh and
Andreas, take each new employee out for lunch on their first day, to help the employee feel comfortable within the
team and in their role as soon as possible. Whilst this might seem like a simple gesture, it sets the relationship off
on a positive note which can have a big impact over the course of years.

Culture isn't something that can be set in place and then ignored. That's why we're making a concerted effort to
develop and nurture our culture as the business, people and world around us evolves.
