On 1 July, the Victorian Government passed new laws that are designed to protect children 
from abuse as well as ensuring that organisations are held more accountable. The new 
legislation follows the implementation of the Victorian Child Safe Standards and Royal 
Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. 

#### Wrong Amendment (Organisational Child Abuse) Act 2017

The new legislation, the Wrong Amendment (Organisational Child Abuse) Act 2017 that was 
passed states that "Victorian religious institutions, childcare facilities, government 
bodies and community organisations have a clear 'duty of care' to protect children under 
their watch." Based on these new requirements, organisations that are involved in the 
supervision and caretaking of children must develop feasible safety measures to prevent 
child abuse. If there are allegations of child abuse, the presumption will be that the 
organisation has failed its duty of care unless it can prove that there were strategies 
in place to stop child abuse.  

#### Reportable Conduct Scheme

The Andrews Labor Government Reportable Conduct Scheme was additionally announced on the 
same day. This scheme makes it compulsory for specific organisations that provide services 
to children to report to the Commission for Children and Young People on any accusations of 
child abuse. This ensures that individuals who are a risk to children would not be permitted 
to work with children, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. Furthermore, the 
Commission will communicate with the Government, pass on information to the Working with 
Children Check Unit and work alongside with the Child Safe Standards department.

> "Children are some of the most vulnerable members of our community and the Andrews Labor 
Government is doing what it can to protect them. Child safety is everyone's responsibility."
Says Minister for Families and Children Jenny Mikakos.

#### Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016

Finally, the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016 is in effect from the 1st of 
July 2017. This act amends 50 sexual offences, modernising them to keep up with constantly 
evolving digital technology. 

> "We're leading Australia with these laws to help protect children from abuse, and hold 
organisations to account." Says Attorney-General Martin Pakula. 

These new pieces of legislation address a need for organisations to be held accountable 
for their negligence and put the onus of responsibility on them.
