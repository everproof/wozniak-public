    <li>
      If the User is a &quot;Consumer&quot; for the purposes of section 3 of
      the Australian Consumer Law and the goods and services which Everproof
      provides are not of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal,
      domestic or household use or consumption, then Everproof's liability to
      the User in relation to any claim relating to the User's access and
      use of the WWCC Checker or otherwise arising under or in connection
      with these Terms is limited, at Everproof's election and discretion to:

      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of

      exclusions in clause 11.2 apply whether the claim is in contract,
      tort (including without limitation, negligence) equity or otherwise
      and even if Everproof has been notified of the possibility of such Loss
      or damage and the User agrees that Everproof's liability, if any, to the
      User at law will be reduced by the extent, if any, to which the User
      contributed to the Loss.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <b>11.2 Consequential Loss</b>
  </p>
